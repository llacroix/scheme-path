# Path module for scheme

Aim to be a copy of the path module in python. Once done, it is possible that
some functions related to POSIX will get deleted. The path module is intended to
make it easier to work with paths.

Knowing if a file/folder exists the time of creation and so on shouldn't be
mixed. I believe it was a mistake to include them in python and I'll probably 
remove them from the module later.
